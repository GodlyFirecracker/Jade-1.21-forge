# 1.20.5 Upgrading Guide

## IWailaCommonRegistration

You can now pass a block class when registering an `IServerDataProvider` or `IServerExtensionProvider`, which means that you can now add
server data providers for blocks that do not have a block entity.

## Canceling requests

A new method called `shouldRequestData` is added to `IServerDataProvider` and `IServerExtensionProvider` to determine on the client side
whether you should request data from the server. In most cases, you should not check for plugin settings in this method. The method
returns `true` by default.

## IServerExtensionProvider

The first type parameter of `IServerExtensionProvider` is removed, and there is only one type parameter now.

The `target` parameter of the `getGroups` method has been removed. You can still get the target from `accessor.getTarget()`, but it may
be `null` because the context is now allowed without a block entity.

## IElementHelper

`ITooltip#getElementHelper` has been removed. You should now use `IElementHelper.get()` directly.
